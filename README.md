### Preface 

In the future, machines will be the primary workforce. MachineFi is a new
paradigm fueled by Web3 that underpins the new machine economy, whereby
machine resources and intelligence can be financialized to deliver value and
ownership to the people, not centralized corporations.
Blockchains are financialization-to-everything protocols: endowing objects (like jPegs of memes) with scarcity. And scarcity attracts markets (aka financialization) like a magnet does iron shavings. Thanks to blockchain we have: DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and GameFi (Game Finance) headlining the explosion.So MachineFi, put simply, is the financialization of machines, or, more precisely: internet-connected devices.

### BarMyPebble
The aim of the app before was to create an NFT marketplace which i did but however interacting with slighly complicated smartcontracts on hedera is still quite difficult due to the lack of verbosity regaring error messaging and the dreaded ``CONTRACT_REVERTED`` error :( 

BarMyPebble is an NFT DApp which allows users to mint locations produced by their pebble devices as NFTs and share these NFTs with others


### How it works
Before interacting with the DApp its imperitive that you register a testnet Pebble device as explained in the following sections
